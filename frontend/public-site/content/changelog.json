      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "Two user-facing bugs persisted after v1.8.7: clicking a share link while an identity was locked or being selected silently lost the link, and file downloads failed immediately with 'Connected peers: 0' instead of retrying. This release fixes both bugs, adds automatic workspace switching when re-joining an existing workspace via share link, and makes file downloads resilient with retry + re-bootstrap."
