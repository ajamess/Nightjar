## Why Nightjar?

**Your documents belong to you, not the cloud.**

Traditional collaboration tools require trusting a third party with your most sensitive information. Every document you create, every edit you make, every comment you leave—all stored on servers you don't control, accessible to companies, hackers, and governments.

Nightjar takes a different approach:

- 🔐 **End-to-End Encrypted** — Your content is encrypted before it leaves your device. Not even relay servers can read your documents.
- 🌐 **Peer-to-Peer** — Connect directly with collaborators. No central server stores your data.
- 🧅 **Tor-Ready** — Optional Tor integration for anonymous collaboration when privacy is critical.
- 💾 **Local-First** — Your documents live on your device. Work offline, sync when connected.
- 🔑 **Self-Sovereign Identity** — Your cryptographic identity is yours. Back it up with a 12-word recovery phrase.

Whether you're a journalist protecting sources, an activist organizing securely, a business handling sensitive contracts, or simply someone who believes privacy is a fundamental right—Nightjar gives you collaboration without compromise.

## Security

Nightjar is built with security as the foundation, not an afterthought.

### Cryptographic Primitives

| Component | Algorithm | Details |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| **Identity Keys** | Ed25519 | Signing keypairs for authentication |
| **Encryption** | XSalsa20-Poly1305 | Authenticated encryption (NaCl) |
| **Key Derivation** | Argon2id | Memory-hard KDF (64MB, 4 iterations) |
| **Recovery Phrase** | BIP39 | 12-word mnemonic (128-bit entropy) |

### How Your Data is Protected

1. **Hierarchical Key Derivation** — Workspace password → Workspace key → Folder key → Document key
2. **Zero-Knowledge Sharing** — Share links contain the encryption key in the URL fragment (never sent to servers)
3. **Traffic Analysis Resistance** — All encrypted payloads padded to 4KB blocks
4. **Signed Invitations** — Invite links are Ed25519-signed with configurable expiry

### Privacy Features

- **No accounts** — Your identity is a keypair you control
- **No tracking** — No analytics, no telemetry, no phone home
- **No cloud storage** — Documents exist only on participants' devices
- **Tor support** — Route all traffic through Tor for anonymity

### What Nightjar Does NOT Protect Against

- Malware on your device
- Collaborators you choose to share with
- Screenshots or copy/paste by authorized users
- Metadata visible to network observers (unless using Tor)

## Architecture

Nightjar uses an **Electron + Sidecar** architecture:

│  • Metadata server (port 8081)                          │
│  • P2P: Hyperswarm + libp2p + Tor                       │
│  • LevelDB encrypted storage                            │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
